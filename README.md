# My Dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed with [rcm][1].

## Install

The install script is meant to help bootstrap an enviornment on a new machine.
This will install homebrew if necessary and the bare necessity packages from
it to make my dotfiles work.

```
git clone https://github.com/derekprior/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/install
```
